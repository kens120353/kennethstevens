## This is where you learn about who I am and what I can do for you.

<p>Hello. My name is Kenneth Stevens, but please call me Ken.genda
I am an American living in the Philippines. Officially I am a retired Computer Programmer/Software Engineer. </p>


<ul>
{% for skill in site.data.skills %}
<li>
{{ skill.skill }}
</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

As far as languages go, if I am not familiar with a language, give me a manual on 
the syntax and 48 hours, I will write you a program in it. Programming is the same no matter what language you program in... so...

I'm also available for instruction. I can also able to teach anything from basoic 
computer usage to advance programming concepts.
